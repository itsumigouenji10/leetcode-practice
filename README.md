# LeetCode Practice üß©

This repository is my personal space for daily algorithm and data structure practice.  
The problems are solved primarily in **Python**, and occasionally I will post some solutions in **C** or **Java** as I broaden my language comfort zone.

## üìö Purpose
- Strengthen problem-solving fundamentals and coding speed.  
- Build a consistent daily habit of writing and reviewing code.  
- Track progress visually through version control and contributions.

I intend to find my love for coding back again!

Each file corresponds to a single problem.  
The `notes/` folder contains explanations, complexity analysis, and alternative approaches.

## üß© Topics Covered
Arrays ‚Ä¢ Strings ‚Ä¢ Linked Lists ‚Ä¢ Recursion ‚Ä¢ Sorting ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Programming ‚Ä¢ Graphs ‚Ä¢ Trees

## üïí Progress Tracking
I aim to solve **at least one problem per day** to maintain a healthy problem-solving rhythm.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
These solutions are for **personal learning and interview preparation**.  
They are not official solutions and may not represent the most optimized approach.
